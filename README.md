# FlexMoney Assignment

You need to build a simple app which obtains credit/debit card details from a user and
submits the data to an API (details below) and displays the response.
The fields required from a user are:

1. Name
2. Credit/Debit card number
3. CVV
4. Expiry month and year
   You should submit this data to a dummy API and display the success or error message as
   applicable. You can find the details of the API below.
   It is expected that your app adapts to different screen sizes, performs data validation and
   has a clean UI. Please write code that is easily extendable using any library you need.
